### Prerequisites

1.  Node.js(v16) + npm(v8)
2.  Gulp installed globally: `npm install gulp --global`

### Development

#### 1\. Clone repo

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/clerky/help-center-front-end.git
```

#### 2\. Go inside the cloned repo

This command watches your changes and builds minified CSS and JS files to `build/css/styles.css` & `build/js/application.js`. 

### Usage

In order to use CSS & JS files in HelpScout, we need to use [githack](https://raw.githack.com/) URLs. 

Here are URLs of `styles.css` and `application.js` files.  

[https://raw.githack.com/clerky/help-center-front-end/main/build/css/styles.css](https://raw.githack.com/clerky/help-center-front-end/main/build/css/styles.css)
